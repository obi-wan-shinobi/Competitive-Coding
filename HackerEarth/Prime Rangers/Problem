Prime Rangers:
You are given a range [L,R]. You are required to determine the prime rangers in this range.
The definition of prime rangers is that the frequency of the smallest prime digit must be grater than
or equal to the frequency of the second-smallest prime digit in a number, the frequency of the
second-smallest prime digit is greater than or equal to the frequency of the third smallest prime digit in
a number, and so on.

Note:
The number of prime rangers may become very large. Therefore, print the prime rangers
modulo 10^9 + 7.


Input format:

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases

Next T lines contain two space-separated integers L and R denoting the range in which you have
to find the prime rangers.


Output Format:

Print the number of prime rangers modulo 10^9 + 7

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= L <=R <= 10^18

Sample input:
2
1 10
31 32

Sample output:
7
1


Explanation:

Test Case 1:
The number 3, 5 and 7 are not prime rangers because in these number the frequency of 2 is 0 but the
frequency of the prime number greater than 2 is 1

Test Case 2:
The number 32 is a prime ranger as the frequency of 2 is 1 and 3 is also 1 which satisfies the condition
that the frequency of the smallest prime digit is less than or equal to the frequency of second smallest prime
digit.
