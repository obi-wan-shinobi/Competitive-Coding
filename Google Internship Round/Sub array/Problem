You are given an array that contains N positive integers a1, a2, a3,..., aN
where all ai are pairwise distinct. For each ai, you are required to determine
the number of subarrays such that the minimum value of that sub array is ai.

A subarray is a contiguous set of elements of an array.

Input format:
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases
The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the array
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, a3, ..., aN

Sample Input:
1
5
3 2 4 1 5

Sample Output:
1 4 1 8 1
